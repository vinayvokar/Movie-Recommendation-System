Small Description
This project builds a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions using content-based filtering (cosine similarity) and sentiment analysis of critic reviews. The model leverages features like genre, director, and audience scores to recommend top movies similar to the user's input.

3 Key Learnings
Understanding content-based filtering using cosine similarity.
Applying sentiment analysis to enrich recommendations.
Integrating machine learning models into a Django web application.
Future Scope and Improvements
Hybrid Recommender: Integrate collaborative filtering with content-based filtering.
User Profile: Personalize recommendations based on user preferences and history.
Real-time Updates: Add a real-time feature to update recommendations as user interactions change.
